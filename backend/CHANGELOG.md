### üîß Improved

#### Code Quality & Standards

  - HTTP status code standardization (200, 201, 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
  - DELETE operations return 204 No Content (no body)

- **Centralized Utilities**
  - `utils/response.js`: Standardized success/error responses
  - `utils/validate.js`: Centralized input validation
  - `utils/files.js`: File operation helpers
  - `utils/email.js`: Email sending abstraction

- **DRY Principles**
  - Removed duplicate code across controllers
  - Reusable helper functions
  - Consistent error handling

#### Database Optimization
